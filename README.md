# muJava_Imporved
This project is to improve the muJava project.

1st phase: Focuse on AORB operation, filter the useless operator replacing
           If right number of expression is 1, filter the *,/,% operators, just remain +,-
           
2nd phase: Deal with multiple operations, old version only can run single operator like -AORB, current new version can run multiple operations like -AORB,-ROR

3rd phase: Deal with sequential execution, old version of muJava only can execute for 1 time, current new version can execute many times until find the absolute correctness

4th phase: Implements stack
